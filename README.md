This personal and (maybe) soon to be community .NET project is for using the Blocktrail API to discover all there is to know about the Bitcoin blockchain.
This includes fetching information about:

* blocks
* transactions
* addresses

The library is written in F# but is usable in any .NET language. The library is still in the Alpha stage but will be updated to include more features and to improve the stability.

Read the [Getting started tutorial](http://raymens.github.io/BlocktrailSdk/index.html#Getting-started) to learn more.
